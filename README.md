Trajectory generation consists of 3 components: the trajectory function, the controller, and the integrator.

The integrator operates on a dynamical system representing the robot's state (x,y,theta,v,w) and desired position (xd,yd). The trajectory function provides the state equations for the desired position, while the controller provides the state equations for the robot.

The trajectory function must therefore provide (xd',yd'). This is straightforward if the desired trajectory can be described analytically (ex. `AngledStraight`, `Circle`, `Serpentine`). 

The `Path` trajectory function is more complicated. In this case, xd and yd are represented as cubic B-splines. The splines are initialized using the `x` and `y` components of the provided poses. During integration, xd' and yd' are provided by querying the splines for their derivatives at the given times.
One issue is that the paths generated by global planning do not contain any timing information for the poses. The current implementation assumes that poses are spaced every 5cm; future versions will attempt to be more general.

Note: the `cubic_b_spline` interpolator is only available with Boost 1.65 and above, while Ubuntu 16.04 by default provides Boost 1.54. As a result, the necessary files have been slightly modified and included with this package. This could potentially cause issues on systems with Boost 1.65.
